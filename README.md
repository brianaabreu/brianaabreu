### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Briana Abreu, a web developer who has been passionate about development since the age of 11. I have been following my dream ever since and every day I am proud to say I learn more and get closer and closer.

I enjoy using React and Node for all of my projects, I have 70 repositories and over half of them use React, so I hope to pursue my career using what I know most, but I am a quick learner. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in Lambda School.
